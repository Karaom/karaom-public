[00:07.98]I want you to know that it's our time
[00:11.99]You and me bleed the same light
[00:15.05]I want you to know that I'm all yours
[00:19.23]You and me run the same course
[00:22.48]I'm slippin' down a chain reaction
[00:25.99]And here I go here I go here I go go
[00:30.00]And once again I'm yours in fractions
[00:33.54]It takes me down pulls me down pulls me down low
[00:37.26]Honey it's raining tonight
[00:40.75]But storms always have an eye have an eye
[00:44.52]Tell me you're covered tonight
[00:48.29]Or tell me lies tell me lies lies

[01:08.79]I want you to know that it's our time
[01:12.74]You and me bleed the same light
[01:16.03]I want you to know that I'm all yours
[01:20.24]You and me run the same course
[01:52.78]I want you to know that it's our time
[01:57.02]You and me bleed the same light
[02:00.27]I'm better under your reflection
[02:03.98]But did you know did you know did you know know?
[02:07.73]That's anybody else that's met ya
[02:11.26]It's all the same all the same all the same glow
[02:15.03]Honey it's raining tonight
[02:18.76]But storms always have an eye have an eye
